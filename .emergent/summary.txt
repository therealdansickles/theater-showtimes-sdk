The previous AI engineer initially transformed a movie booking page clone into a full-stack SaaS application with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, focusing on customization and an admin dashboard. The project then transitioned to developing a mobile-optimized SDK. In the provided trajectory, the engineer addressed a new user request to implement dynamic search categories (e.g., IMAX, Live Q&A) and time-based filtering (day/evening showtimes) for the SDK, prioritizing React Native for mobile. This involved extensive backend model and API updates, alongside significant modifications to both React web and React Native SDK components. Concurrently, the build system for the SDK was enhanced for robustness and multiple output formats (CommonJS, ES Module, UMD). Despite encountering and resolving several dependency and TypeScript errors during the build process, the engineer successfully generated the required SDK builds. The work demonstrates a methodical approach to feature expansion and infrastructure hardening.

The project began as a frontend-only clone of a movie ticket booking page (f1themovie.com), emphasizing pixel-perfect design, visual experience, and responsive UI with mocked data. This evolved into a SaaS platform for customizable movie booking pages, requiring a backend for features like gradient selection, image uploads, and emoji overlays. The final evolution was to package this as a production-ready, mobile-optimized SDK for integration into a larger decentralized media ecosystem. The latest explicit requests included enabling creation/deletion of search categories per film (e.g., IMAX, Live Q&A, Live Activations) and showtime filtering by day/evening, with a strong focus on mobile (iOS/Android) optimization and a robust, flexible build system for distribution.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed a significant phase of work: enhancing the movie booking SDK with dynamic search categories and time-based showtime filtering, and establishing a robust build system.

**Phase 1: Enhanced Search & Category Features**
-   **Backend**:  model, / schemas were updated to support  and  objects. A new FastAPI route file, , was created to manage CRUD operations for screening categories (e.g., IMAX, Live Q&A). The main  route was modified to allow filtering by these new categories and time slots.
-   **SDK Types**:  was updated to reflect the new  and  interfaces, ensuring type safety across the SDK.
-   **SDK Utilities**:  received new helper functions (, ) for time-based categorization logic.
-   **Frontend Components**: Both  (React web) and  (React Native) were extensively modified to incorporate the new dynamic category and time-based filtering UI and logic, including new styles and tabbed filtering for mobile. A fix was also applied to  to handle the new time object structure from the backend.

**Phase 2: Robust Build System Setup**
-   The build system for the SDK in  was enhanced. This involved modifying  and  to support multiple output formats (CommonJS, ES Module, UMD) crucial for flexible distribution within a decentralized media ecosystem. New configuration files like , , and  were created.
-   Throughout this phase, the engineer actively troubleshooted and resolved dependency conflicts (e.g.,  plugin), TypeScript errors (temporarily relaxing  strictness), and module import issues in . An example application () was updated to demonstrate the new features.

The current state is that the core features for dynamic categorization and time filtering are implemented across the backend and SDK components (React/React Native), and the build system for the SDK is successfully producing distributable bundles in multiple formats, albeit with some TypeScript warnings related to React Native types. Backend API tests for categories and time slots have passed.
