The AI engineer successfully transformed a movie booking page into a comprehensive SaaS platform and SDK. Key initial efforts focused on dynamic search, time-based filtering, and a robust build system for the SDK. A major security overhaul followed, integrating JWT authentication, API key management, and rate limiting. The engineer then tackled a plug-and-play checklist, adding a transaction API placeholder, rich film pages, and a setup wizard. However, an immediate post-completion issue arose: the Setup film page was inaccessible after admin login due to a missing JWT secret key, which was promptly resolved. Subsequently, a significant design revision for the film landing page was implemented, including layout changes, dynamic badge support, and mobile optimization. The latest feedback indicates persistent mobile formatting issues, which the engineer is actively addressing by inspecting and correcting CSS and component structures.

The project's evolution aimed to create a modular, white-label SDK for the Litebeem decentralized media ecosystem. Initially, the focus was on a pixel-perfect movie booking clone, evolving into a SaaS platform with dynamic search categories (IMAX, Live Q&A) and time-based showtime filtering, prioritizing React Native compatibility and robust SDK building.
Subsequent requirements included comprehensive security: JWT authentication for admin endpoints, unique API keys per client for tracking, and tiered rate limiting. The plug-and-play phase introduced a transaction API placeholder, enhanced film pages with social integration, improved landing page UX (aspect ratios, tooltips), and a multi-step film setup wizard with auto-validation.
The latest directive, LITEBEEM THEATER SHOWTIMES SDK â€” FRONTEND COMPLETION DIRECTIVE, focuses on finalizing the design and functionality. This includes a two-panel layout, dynamic styling based on  (colors, typography), a hamburger menu for navigation (Home, Videos, Synopsis, Group Sales, Get Tickets), dynamic social icons, a fixed 2:3 poster display, dynamic promotional badges, enhanced showtime filters (location, date, format, time of day), a dedicated Videos page (HTML5 player for , ), a Synopsis page for , and a Group Sales page with CTA. The overall goal is a professional, secure, and easily integratable SDK ready for production deployment, featuring dynamic content and flexible styling.

The codebase is structured into  (React),  (FastAPI), and  (SDK package), along with  and .



- ****: Defines MongoDB data models. Updated to include , , , , and to enhance  with , , , , , and . Recently,  was updated to optionally include , , and .  was further updated to include  and .
- ****: Contains JWT token generation, verification, and password hashing. Critical for authentication. It was found that  was not persistently set, causing token invalidation on server restart. This was fixed by adding  to .
- ****: Main React application entry. Modified to use , protect  route, and include new routes for  and . It was later completely rewritten to incorporate the  and new page components (, , ), temporarily using mock data for styling.
- ****: (Newly created) Implements React Context for global authentication state management. Verified as properly handling token storage and user state.
- ****: (Newly created) Multi-step form for film teams. Updated to include a new section for uploading  and  by modifying the  function to handle array-based uploads.
- ****: Contains core React UI components. Heavily modified and restructured due to truncation issues. The  component was simplified by removing Admin and Login buttons, keeping minimal navigation. The  was redesigned for a three-column layout (Poster, Text, Showtimes), incorporating dynamic badge rendering. Contains , , , and  components.
- ****, ****, ****: (Newly created) Dedicated pages for specific film content, following the new two-panel layout directive.
- ****: (Newly created) Implements the new global two-panel structure, handling responsive behavior and integrating styling from . Updated for better mobile support.
- ****: (Newly created) Component for mobile navigation menu.
- ****: (Newly created) Stores mock JSON data for theaters and screening times to facilitate frontend layout testing without backend dependency.
- ****: (Newly created) Catches React errors gracefully to prevent app crashes.
- ****: (Newly created) Handles robust image loading, displaying spinners during load, and providing fallbacks.
- ****: Contains custom CSS. Updated for enhanced typography, uniform button styles, improved grid alignment, dynamic background gradients, and mobile responsiveness.
- ****: Used to store environment variables like  and .  was added to ensure consistent JWT token generation.
- ****: Continuously updated with test outcomes, user problem statements, and communication.

<pending_tasks>
- Set up infrastructure for deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, CDN).
- Conduct comprehensive E2E testing and performance benchmarking.
- Publish the SDK to NPM and set up a documentation site.
- Debug and fix the remaining mobile formatting issues, specifically for the Hamburger Navigation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user complaint regarding mobile formatting. Despite significant design revisions being completed and confirmed, the user reported that the application's mobile layout was all messed up and unreadable when viewed on a phone.

The engineer identified this as a high-priority bug and started systematically debugging it. The current approach involves:
1.  **Checking Viewport Meta Tag**: The engineer verified  to ensure the viewport meta tag was correctly configured for responsive behavior. (Chat Message 251: )
2.  **Fixing Mobile-First CSS**: The engineer updated  to implement proper mobile-first responsive design, likely adjusting breakpoints, flexbox/grid properties, and element sizing for small screens. (Chat Message 253: )
3.  **Updating TwoPanelLayout Component**: The  file was updated to better support mobile displays, presumably by applying the new responsive CSS classes and adjusting its internal rendering logic for stacked layouts. (Chat Message 255: )

The very last action in the trajectory (Chat Message 256) indicates the next step in this current task:
## Step 4: Fix Hamburger Navigation for Mobile

This shows the engineer is in the process of applying mobile-specific fixes to the hamburger menu component to ensure it renders and functions correctly on smaller screens.
