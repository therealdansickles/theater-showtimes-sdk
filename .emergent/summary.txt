The AI engineer successfully progressed through distinct phases: first, creating a pixel-perfect frontend clone of the F1 movie booking page, prioritizing visual replication and user experience to achieve an AHA MOMENT. This involved extensive use of  and  tools for design inspiration and content gathering. Second, the application evolved into a full-fledged SaaS platform with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, offering extensive customization options like gradients, image uploads, and emoji overlays for buttons. This phase focused on multi-tenancy and a comprehensive admin dashboard. Finally, the project transitioned into developing a production-ready, mobile-optimized SDK for broader integration. The AI engineer has consistently followed the multi-step development process, utilizing prescribed tools and prioritizing user explicit requests, effectively transforming a simple clone into a deployable, customizable software component.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to build a frontend-only clone of a movie ticket booking page, specifically replicating https://www.f1themovie.com/. The replica needed to prioritize exact design, colors, visual experience, and layout hierarchy, aiming for an immediate AHA MOMENT. This included multi-page UI or pop-up modals if present, mocked data, and close UI/UX replication. Key design elements specified were premium visual language (black/red F1 theme), typography system (dramatic type scales, varied weights), color strategy (atmospheric gradients), and page components with hover effects. The implementation approach emphasized planning, design development, and frontend development with smooth scrolling, responsiveness, and subtle animations.

The product then evolved into a SaaS platform where any film could customize its ticket booking page. This required a backend system enabling holistic customization options like gradient selection, JPEG uploads, and emoji overlays on buttons. Finally, the user requested to package this service as an SDK, optimized for mobile, to be an extension of a larger platform, requiring a production-ready, deployable structure with multi-platform support (React, React Native, Vanilla JS, iframe).

<code_architecture>
The codebase is structured with distinct directories for frontend, backend, and SDK, reflecting the project's evolution.



-   : Main React component. Initially a basic scaffold, it was later updated to integrate the booking functionality and dynamically render based on backend data.
-   : This file holds the core React components for the movie ticket booking UI, following a monolithic approach. It was created to house the hero section, movie booking interface, theater selection, and time selection based on the F1 movie clone requirements.
-   : This new file was introduced during the SaaS phase to host the React components for the admin dashboard, allowing for real-time customization of the movie booking page (gradients, colors, buttons, images).
-   : The main FastAPI server file. This was identified as the existing backend entry point and later updated to include API routes for the SaaS platform's customization features, client management, and data handling.
-   : Defines the MongoDB data models (e.g., MovieConfig, Client, Theme) using Pydantic, crucial for the SaaS platform's data structure and customization options.
-   : Handles MongoDB connection and operations, ensuring persistent storage for the SaaS configurations.
-   : Contains Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for interacting with the MongoDB models, supporting the backend's API logic.
-   : Defines the Pydantic schemas for request and response validation, ensuring data integrity for API interactions.
-   : This was likely created or updated to orchestrate the FastAPI application, bringing together routes, models, and database connections for the SaaS functionality.
-   : A newly created directory for packaging the movie booking system as a reusable SDK.
-   : The main entry point for the SDK, exporting its core functionalities and components.
-   , , , , , : These files contain the React web components, which were recently implemented as part of completing the SDK's core functionality.
-   , , , : These files hold the React Native components for mobile optimization, also recently implemented to complete the SDK.

The architecture reflects a clear separation of concerns, moving from a monolithic frontend clone to a structured full-stack SaaS application, and finally to a reusable, multi-platform SDK.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the build system setup and configuration files for the SDK (e.g., , , , ).
-   Implement security measures for the SDK (JWT auth, rate limiting).
-   Set up infrastructure for deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, CDN).
-   Conduct comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E) and performance benchmarking.
-   Publish the SDK to NPM and set up a documentation site.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing the remaining components for the newly structured SDK. This involved completing both the React web components and the React Native mobile components.

Specifically, the following React components for web integration have been successfully written:
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   

Additionally, the following React Native components for mobile optimization have been successfully written:
-   
-   
-   
-   

The current state of the product is that the core UI components for the SDK across both web (React) and mobile (React Native) platforms have been implemented. The next logical step, as indicated by the AI engineer, is to set up the build system for the SDK. The  file also outlines further steps like security, infrastructure, testing, and distribution.
