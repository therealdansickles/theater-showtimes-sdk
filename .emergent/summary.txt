The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned a movie booking page clone into a robust full-stack SaaS application with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, then packaged core functionalities into a mobile-optimized SDK. Key achievements include implementing dynamic search categories (e.g., IMAX, Live Q&A) and time-based filtering for showtimes, supported by extensive backend API and model updates, and significant modifications to both React web and React Native SDK components. A resilient build system for the SDK (CommonJS, ES Module, UMD) was established. The engineer successfully integrated comprehensive JWT authentication, API key management, and rate limiting, securing critical endpoints. Repository hygiene was maintained through systematic file organization and documentation. The engineer completed a broad plug-and-play checklist, introducing new features like a transaction API placeholder, enhanced film pages with social integration, and a multi-step film setup wizard. The current state is that the user reports an issue accessing the Setup film page after admin login, contradicting the engineer's final complete status for plug-and-play features.

The project evolved from a pixel-perfect movie booking page clone to a customizable SaaS platform, and finally into a production-ready, mobile-optimized SDK for a decentralized media ecosystem (Litebeem). The initial scope focused on dynamic search categories (e.g., IMAX, Live Q&A) and time-based showtime filtering for the SDK, prioritizing React Native, with a robust build system.

Subsequent explicit requirements included comprehensive security measures: JWT authentication for admin/management endpoints (public endpoints remain open), individual API keys per client for tracking/monetization, and tiered rate limiting (60/200/500 requests/minute for public/authenticated/admin endpoints). The latest phase involved implementing a plug-and-play integration checklist, encompassing a placeholder transaction API, rich film pages with social integration, improved landing page UX (image aspect ratios, tooltips, previews), a multi-step film team upload/setup wizard with auto-validation, and optional enhancements like calendar integration. The user's ultimate goal is a professional, secure, and easily integratable SDK ready for production deployment within Litebeem's ecosystem.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React, React Native, TailwindCSS, Axios (for API calls).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (via PyMongo), Pydantic (for schemas), JWT (PyJWT, python-jose), Passlib/Bcrypt (for hashing).
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack, Component-based design, SDK packaging, RESTful APIs, Multi-tenancy (SaaS).
-   **Build/Deployment**: Rollup.js (for SDK bundling), TypeScript, NPM, Yarn, Supervisor (process management), Docker/Kubernetes (environment).

<pending_tasks>
-   Set up infrastructure for deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, CDN).
-   Conduct comprehensive testing (unit, E2E) and performance benchmarking (beyond integration tests).
-   Publish the SDK to NPM and set up a documentation site.
-   Debug and fix the admin login issue preventing access to the Setup film page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the Plug-and-Play Integration Checklist, claiming all 24 items were implemented and the SDK was production-ready. This involved:
-   **Backend Enhancements**: Creating a placeholder  endpoint, and significantly enhancing the  model in  to support comprehensive film page details (trailer URLs, synopsis, release dates, social links, image upload guidelines). New frontend components like  and  were created to leverage these updates.
-   **Frontend Updates**: Implementing  for dynamic film landing pages and  for a multi-step film team upload flow.  was updated to include routes for these new components, and  was modified to add a link to the setup wizard in the Header.
-   **Repository Cleanup**: Prior to these feature additions, a major repository cleanup was performed, moving all utility scripts to , organizing test files into  and , regenerating , and creating a comprehensive .

However, despite the engineer's assertion of completion, the *most recent user feedback* (Chat Message 451) indicates a critical functional issue: the user cannot access the Setup film page after logging into the admin page. This implies a problem with the frontend authentication flow, routing, or the integration of the admin dashboard itself, directly contradicting the production-ready status claimed by the AI engineer. The AI engineer is currently investigating this specific admin login/dashboard access issue.
