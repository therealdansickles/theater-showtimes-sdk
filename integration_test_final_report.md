# Movie Booking SDK Integration Test Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings from comprehensive testing of the Movie Booking SDK integration between frontend and backend components. The backend APIs are functioning correctly, but there is a critical issue in the frontend integration that prevents the UI from rendering properly.

## Backend API Testing Results

✅ **All backend API endpoints are working correctly:**

1. **Categories API:**
   - GET `/api/categories/` - Returns 37 categories
   - POST `/api/categories/` - Successfully creates new categories
   - PUT `/api/categories/{id}` - Successfully updates categories
   - DELETE `/api/categories/{id}` - Successfully deletes categories

2. **Time Categories API:**
   - GET `/api/categories/time-categories/available` - Returns 4 time categories (morning, afternoon, evening, late_night)

3. **Movies API:**
   - GET `/api/movies/` - Successfully retrieves movie configurations
   - GET `/api/movies/{id}` - Successfully retrieves specific movie details

4. **Showtimes API:**
   - GET `/api/movies/{id}/showtimes/categorized` - Successfully returns theaters with showtimes
   - Filtering by time_category works correctly
   - Filtering by screening_category works correctly
   - Combined filtering works correctly

5. **Health and Status APIs:**
   - GET `/api/health` - Reports system as healthy
   - GET `/api/` - Returns active status and available endpoints

## Frontend Integration Issues

❌ **The frontend integration is broken due to a mismatch between API response structure and component expectations:**

1. **TheaterCard Component Error:**
   - JavaScript error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')`
   - The component expects `theater.chain.charAt(0)`, but the API response doesn't include a `chain` property

2. **API Response vs. Frontend Expectations Mismatch:**
   - API returns theaters with properties like `theater_name`, `theater_address`, and `screening_formats`
   - TheaterCard component expects properties like `name`, `address`, `chain`, and `formats`
   - The structure of showtimes is also different between API and component expectations

3. **Network Requests:**
   - The frontend correctly makes API calls to the backend endpoints
   - The API responses are valid and contain the necessary data
   - The frontend fails to transform the API response to match component expectations

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the integration issue is in the MovieBookingPage component in App.js. When fetching theaters from the API, it directly sets the response data to state without transforming it to match the structure expected by the TheaterCard component:

```javascript
setTheaters(response.data.theaters || []);
```

This causes a rendering error because the TheaterCard component tries to access properties that don't exist in the API response structure.

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Transform API Response:**
   Update the useEffect hook in App.js to transform the API response to match the expected format:

   ```javascript
   const transformedTheaters = (response.data.theaters || []).map(theater => ({
     name: theater.theater_name,
     address: theater.theater_address,
     chain: theater.theater_name.split(' ')[0], // Extract chain from theater name
     distance: 0, // Not provided in API response
     formats: theater.screening_formats.map(format => ({
       type: format.category_name,
       times: Object.values(format.times_by_category)
         .flat()
         .filter(t => t.time)
         .map(t => t.time)
     }))
   }));

   setTheaters(transformedTheaters);
   ```

2. **Update TheaterCard Component:**
   Alternatively, update the TheaterCard component to work with the API response format directly:

   ```javascript
   export const TheaterCard = ({ theater, onSelectTheater, movieConfig }) => {
     // ...
     <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 mb-2">
       <div className="bg-white text-black rounded-full w-8 h-8 flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-sm">
         {theater.theater_name ? theater.theater_name.charAt(0) : 'T'}
       </div>
       <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">{theater.theater_name || theater.name}</h3>
     </div>
     <p className="text-sm opacity-90 mb-3">{theater.theater_address || theater.address}</p>
     // ...
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

The Movie Booking SDK has a well-functioning backend API system that correctly handles categories, time categories, movies, and showtimes. The frontend integration issue is isolated to a data structure mismatch between the API response and component expectations. This can be fixed by either transforming the API response or updating the component to handle the API response format directly.

Once this integration issue is resolved, the system should function correctly, allowing users to filter theaters by format and time categories, and displaying the appropriate theaters based on those filters.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommended fix for the frontend integration issue
2. Conduct additional testing to ensure the fix resolves the rendering error
3. Verify that all filtering functionality works correctly after the fix
4. Consider adding error boundaries to prevent UI crashes in case of similar issues in the future
