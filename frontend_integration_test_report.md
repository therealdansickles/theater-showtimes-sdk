# Movie Booking SDK Frontend Integration Test Report

## Summary

The frontend integration with the backend API is currently broken due to a mismatch between the API response structure and what the frontend components expect. This is causing a JavaScript error in the TheaterCard component, preventing the UI from rendering properly.

## Backend API Verification

✅ **Backend API Endpoints**: All required backend API endpoints are working correctly:
- `/api/categories/` - Returns 29 categories
- `/api/categories/time-categories/available` - Returns 4 time categories (morning, afternoon, evening, late_night)
- `/api/movies/{movie_id}/showtimes/categorized` - Returns theaters with showtimes filtered by time category and screening category

## Frontend Integration Issues

❌ **Frontend Rendering**: The frontend fails to render properly due to a JavaScript error in the TheaterCard component.

### Error Details

The error occurs in the TheaterCard component when trying to access `theater.chain.charAt(0)`, but the API response doesn't include a `chain` property in the theater objects.

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')
at TheaterCard (https://f89fb794-9619-4452-9198-7d7904651861.preview.emergentagent.com/static/js/bundle.js:2843:37)
```

### API Response vs. Frontend Expectations

#### API Response Structure:
```json
{
  "theater_id": "8b1e90b4-0a0d-41a4-b493-6622ee93b312",
  "theater_name": "Test Theater",
  "theater_address": "123 Test St",
  "screening_formats": [
    {
      "category_name": "2D",
      "category_id": "format_2d",
      "times_by_category": {
        "morning": [],
        "afternoon": [],
        "evening": [
          {
            "time": "7:00 PM",
            "category": "evening",
            "available_seats": null,
            "price_modifier": 1
          }
        ],
        "late_night": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Expected by TheaterCard Component:
```javascript
{
  name: "AMC COUNCIL BLUFFS 17",
  chain: "AMC",
  address: "2025 KENT AVENUE, COUNCIL BLUFFS, IA, 51503",
  distance: 4,
  formats: [
    { type: "IMAX 2D", times: ["10:30PM"] },
    { type: "AMC PRIME", times: ["9:30PM"] }
  ]
}
```

## Network Request Analysis

The frontend is making the correct API calls:
- GET `/api/categories/`
- GET `/api/categories/time-categories/available`
- GET `/api/movies/{movie_id}/showtimes/categorized?time_category=evening`

However, the frontend is not transforming the API response to match the expected format before passing it to the TheaterCard component.

## Root Cause

In App.js, the MovieBookingPage component fetches theaters from the API and directly sets them to state without transformation:

```javascript
setTheaters(response.data.theaters || []);
```

The TheaterCard component expects a different structure than what the API provides, causing the rendering error.

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Transform API Response**: Update the useEffect hook in App.js to transform the API response to match the expected format:

```javascript
const transformedTheaters = (response.data.theaters || []).map(theater => ({
  name: theater.theater_name,
  address: theater.theater_address,
  chain: theater.theater_name.split(' ')[0], // Extract chain from theater name
  distance: 0, // Not provided in API response
  formats: theater.screening_formats.map(format => ({
    type: format.category_name,
    times: Object.values(format.times_by_category)
      .flat()
      .filter(t => t.time)
      .map(t => t.time)
  }))
}));

setTheaters(transformedTheaters);
```

2. **Update TheaterCard Component**: Alternatively, update the TheaterCard component to work with the API response format directly:

```javascript
export const TheaterCard = ({ theater, onSelectTheater, movieConfig }) => {
  // ...
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 mb-2">
    <div className="bg-white text-black rounded-full w-8 h-8 flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-sm">
      {theater.theater_name ? theater.theater_name.charAt(0) : 'T'}
    </div>
    <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">{theater.theater_name || theater.name}</h3>
  </div>
  <p className="text-sm opacity-90 mb-3">{theater.theater_address || theater.address}</p>
  // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

The backend APIs are working correctly, but there's a mismatch between the API response structure and what the frontend components expect. This is causing a JavaScript error that prevents the UI from rendering properly. The issue can be fixed by either transforming the API response to match the expected format or updating the TheaterCard component to work with the API response format directly.
